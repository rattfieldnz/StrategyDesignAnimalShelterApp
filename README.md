StrategyDesignAnimalShelterApp
==============================

This another C# project where I was learning how to implement the Strategy Design factory. You can select a radio button (Cats, Dogs, Ducks, Rabbits), click on the "Show Pets" button, and text-based information about the animals (belonging to the selected species) will be displayed in the listbox. If there are 4 or less of the particular species, their images will be displayed on the right hand side. Through using the Strategy Design pattern, I was able to decouple a lot of code - especially from the form, and attempt to apply Single Responsibility and Open-Closed principles to the application.
